# Alberta Roadtest Finder
A tool to periodically check the AB Road Test Scheduler and look for openings.


## Function
This tool was created out of necessity. In 2018-19 the Alberta Road Test program switched to a private model, resulting in months-long waitlists.

This tool checked for openings and sent emails when it found them. Thanks to it I was able to bring the two-month-long wait down to just two days.

## Technologies
* Java SE
* JavaFX (for a GUI to register)
* JSON (`gson` to parse)
* Selenium
* Apache ANT Compiling
* Semantic Versioning

## Deprecation notice
As of Summer 2020 the scheduling system has once again undergone an overhaul and as such this tool will no longer work.

However, I'm due to take my advanced road test soon, so expect an updated version :)
